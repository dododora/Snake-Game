A classic Snake game reimagined in 3D space, implemented using pure WebGL.  
This is the final project for the **Computer Graphics** course at **National Taiwan Normal University (NTNU)**.

## 🎮 Features

- Move the snake in 3D space using `W`, `A`, `S`, `D`
- Eat food to grow longer, avoid hitting yourself or the wall
- Switch between:
  - **First-Person View** (see through the snake's head)
  - **Third-Person View** (top-down perspective)
- Dynamic snake movement animation
- Texture-mapped environment (ground, walls)
- Cube map background (skybox)
- Phong shading with point light (on food or scene)
- Reflective snake body using cube map reflection
- Optional: Bump mapping or shadows (bonus effects)
